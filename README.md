Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing: Can you cut the time a Mercedes-Benz spends on the test bench?


# Repository for Kaggle Competition [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercedes-benz-greener-manufacturing)
In this competition, Daimler is challenging Kagglers to tackle the *curse of dimensionality* and *reduce the time* that cars spend on the test bench. Competitors will work with a dataset representing different permutations of Mercedes-Benz car features to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Winning algorithms will contribute to speedier testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Daimlerâ€™s standards. *[Source] (https://www.kaggle.com/c/mercedes-benz-greener-manufacturing)
